This repository includes the scripts to train segmentation for document images Challenge. 
In this regard, I build a multi-label model which is capable of identifying and segmenting document images such as character, page, and ornament.
A PyTorch implementation of paper based on icpr 2021 paper segmentation of a Generative Adversarial Network.

Step 1: Generative Adversarial Networks will be added soon.

**Step 2: Test sample images Datasets**

python segmentation.py --imgDIR ./TRainingImages/1.jpg --Train 25

optional arguments:
--`train`             number of epochs [default value is 25]
